# Alexander Kozhin's App Development Exam project

This repository contains my App Development Exam Project code.

I have built an MVP for [Mind Arena](https://mind-arena.streamlit.app/).

- On the **Welcome** start, users are welcomed with login, user authentication, and register features.
- **Home** page with a personalised greeting, getting started block, and active challenges.
- **Curated books** page with 3 themed carousels. Each carousel contains 3 book cards and a navigation arrow.
- **Curated movies** page with 3 themed carousels. Each carousel contains 3 movie cards and a navigation arrow.
-  The buttons **challenge yourself** are available to add a certain book or movie to your Active challenges list
- The buttons **remove** are available on the **Home** page after any challenges had been added.
- Lastly, **share challenge** buttons are available to users to generate an invite for their friends.



- I hope you will enjoy my deployed [Mind Arena](https://mind-arena.streamlit.app/) application! :)
